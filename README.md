Foxes, the blight of modern day life in Britain. Defecating in our gardens, [licking our FACES](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2421749/Corporate-lawyers-horror-caught-fox-licking-year-old-daughters-FACE-home.html) and [attacking our babies](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-125763/Parents-tell-horror-fox-attacks-sleeping-baby.html).
