Foxes, the blight of modern day life in Britain. Defecating in our gardens, [licking our FACES](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2421749/Corporate-lawyers-horror-caught-fox-licking-year-old-daughters-FACE-home.html) and [attacking our babies](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-125763/Parents-tell-horror-fox-attacks-sleeping-baby.html).

It is time to take action against this menace.


## How to do it

Grab the source. Go to the root directory.

`npm install`

`node app.js` (probably do `npm install -g nodemon` and do `nodemon app.js` for file watching goodness)

go in the browser to here: http://localhost:8008/viewer.html

Have a little peak in the browser console for event logging...
